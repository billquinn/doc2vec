# doc2vec
This repository holds Jupyter Notebooks that I use to explore textual similarity within twentieth-century magazines from the Modernist Journals Project. I use doc2vec from gensim to measure textual similarity. The files here serve as experiments and proofs-of-concept rather than arguments for literary history.
